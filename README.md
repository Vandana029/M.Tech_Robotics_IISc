ðŸ¤– M.Tech in Robotics and Autonomous Systems Journey: Notes, Code, and Resources for My Courses. Join Me on the Learning Adventure! ðŸš€

Welcome to My M.Tech Robotics and Autonomous Systems Journey! ðŸ¤–

This is my space to document my M.Tech adventure in robotics and autonomous systems at IISc, Bangalore. Here's what you can expect:

* What's Inside: You'll find my lecture notes, code, videos, and other resources related to all my courses which I'll be taking in my every semester.

* Sharing and Collaboration: I'm all about sharing what I learn and collaborating with anyone interested. Whether you're a fellow student or just curious about robotics, join me on this ride!

* Who It's For: if you're passionate about robots, you're welcome too but Primarily, this is for my peers, especially those coming from different academic backgrounds like me. As this will repo will be specific to their coursework, they will be most benifitted.

* The Backstory: Coming from a computer science background, I know how overwhelming this journey can be. There will be completly new subjects with no idea how or from where to start?? I'll share prerequisites for those subjects, specially for first semester so that at least we won't be like headless fly running here and there without destination. Along with that, learning resources like which video to watch and which book to follow, I'll be sharing those things also. I'll keep updating as I progress through each course and semester. Expect some cool projects too! ðŸ˜„

Feel free to reach out if you have questions; I'll do my best to respond. Let's explore robotics together! ðŸš€ðŸ“šðŸ¤–
